# ideas for features
- automatic pull when upstream is updated (and possibility to turn this off)
- store custom emojis/categories locally
- connect to Jira/Trello/Whatever to fetch ticket numbers automatically
- store change log in standing dir and display it more elegantly 
- clear and redisplay terminal more elegantly when changes in standing dir
- automatic creation of feature branches if ticket number is provided beforehand
